        the actual keyword arguments going to the peer node method call.

        e.g.
        ``invoke_request('testing', [], {'_timeout': 22, '__timeout: 10.0})``
        would call a request method ``testing(_timeout=22)`` on the RPC peer
        and wait for the response for 10 seconds.

          Use either arguments or keyword arguments. Both can't
